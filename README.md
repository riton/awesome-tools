Curated list of awesome tools I'm using or plan to use.

* [Terminals](#terminals)

## Shells

### Sidecards

* [atuin](https://github.com/ellie/atuin) - Magical shell history by replacing your existing shell history with a SQLite database, and records additional context for your commands

## Terminals

### Multiplexers

* [zellij](https://github.com/zellij-org/zellij) - At its core, `zellij` is a terminal multiplexer (similar to `tmux` and GNU `screen`), but very simple to use and user-friendly.
